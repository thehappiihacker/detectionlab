<h1>Detection And Monitoring Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In the realm of cybersecurity, applying and implementing security concepts can present challenges when practical and secure infrastructure is lacking. Bearing this in mind, I undertook this project. This homelab guides you through the steps of configuring, optimizing, and securing an IT infrastructure. While the scale may be modest, the skills acquired can be readily applied to larger, real-world enterprise setups.
